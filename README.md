# Splunk-Endpoint-Compromise
Investigated a multi-stage endpoint compromise using Splunk SIEM and Sysmon telemetry. Correlated initial browser payload delivery, PowerShell execution, Scheduled Task persistence, and outbound C2 traffic into an actionable Incident Response report.
# Splunk SIEM Investigation: Endpoint Compromise & Persistence

## Objective
The goal of this project was to utilize Splunk SIEM to investigate a simulated endpoint compromise. By analyzing raw Sysmon telemetry, the objective was to trace the attacker's execution chain from initial payload delivery to the establishment of SYSTEM-level persistence, and extract actionable Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

## Scenario Overview
A user reported suspicious mouse movement on their workstation. Using Splunk, I correlated endpoint and network telemetry to uncover a multi-stage intrusion. 

**Key Findings:**
*   **Initial Access:** Payload downloaded via Google Chrome.
*   **Execution:** Manual execution of a masqueraded binary (`python.exe`).
*   **Command & Control (C2):** Outbound TCP beaconing to `157.245.46.190:8888`.
*   **Persistence:** Abuse of PowerShell and Task Scheduler to create a `SYSTEM` level startup task.
